# Tic Tac Toe – Prompt Engineering

This Tic Tac Toe game is a **prompt engineering project**, created with the help of an AI model. Most of the initial code was generated by AI, and additional improvements, adaptations, and game logic were implemented manually.

## Features

- **Solo Mode**: Classic Tic Tac Toe for two players taking turns placing circles and crosses.  
- **Computer Mode**: Play against the AI, which automatically plays crosses.  
- **Animated Symbols**: Circles and crosses are drawn with smooth animations when placed.  
- **Winning Line**: A white line highlights the three connected symbols when a player wins.  
- **Restart Functionality**: The game can be restarted at any time.  
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Installation / Usage

1. Clone the repository or download as a ZIP.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Select a mode:  
   - **Solo** – players alternate turns with circles and crosses.  
   - **Computer** – you are circles, the computer automatically plays crosses.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.  
2. Select a mode:  
   - **Solo** – players alternate turns with circles and crosses.  
   - **Computer** – you are circles, the AI automatically plays crosses.  
3. Click on a cell to place your symbol.  
4. The game ends when one player wins or all cells are filled.  
5. Use the restart button to play again.

## Highlights

- The project is a **collaboration between human coding and AI-generated code**.  
- AI was mainly used to generate and optimize the SVG animations and initial game structure.  
- All core logic (game rules, winner detection, computer moves) was developed in stages with AI assistance, with each part generated and refined step by step rather than the entire project at once.
- Demonstrates **how AI can accelerate front-end development** while still requiring human oversight.

## Technologies

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- SVG for animated symbols
